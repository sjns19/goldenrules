                <p class="section-sub-title txt-grey txt-bold txt-md mt-1">GoldenRules is a group of young investors who are passionate about trading and devote their daily lives around the markets.</p>
                <p class="section-paragraph txt-grey mt-1">Our goal is not to become a “guru” of trading, but actually help those in need of developing this skillset. We have spent thousands of hours and dollars in order to learn what we know now and have helped countless of persons to understand the markets without any monetary gains, we believe that the purpose of this life is to help others however we can and adapting this skillset can be quite challenging and frustrating so we are here to ensure that you have a community to lean on and personal mentors to guide you through your trading journey. We know our mentorship won’t be for everyone but we want those with a certain level of seriousness and seeking help to find it here. The trading industry is filled with a lot of scammers and “guru’s” that’s giving the trading industry a bad name, because of our knowledge of these situations we decided to be one of the few forex companies that focuses more on the process to becoming a profitable trader rather than showcasing a lifestyle.</p>

              <p class="section-paragraph txt-grey mx-3">Naturally, one would assume that the goal of a company that sells a trading mentorship programme would be to bring in as many customers as possible. In this case, that is not correct. We have been helping inexperienced traders from 2019 to becoming profitable traders without monetary gains we have then realized how helpful our mentorship is and have now decided to develop a curriculum that can help both seasoned and inexperience traders. Our goal is not to sell you our courses. Our goal is to ensure that this purchase is the final forex education purchase you will ever make. This ties along to why our mentorship program is priced as is.</p>

                <p class="section-paragraph txt-grey mt-1">At GoldenRules, we focus more on institutional trading that allows us to know what the big banks are about to do and avoid making retail trading mistakes that causes the majority to fail in this industry. Retail traders often want different indicators to line up properly to give them confirmations in the markets while us at GoldenRules avoid using indicators and focus on raw price action otherwise known as market structure, we study the movement of price and understand that when price is down at a level where Banks and institutions are buying then hesitation isn’t an option.</p>
                <p class="section-paragraph txt-grey mt-1">If you wait on too many confirmations by using indicators and not understanding price action all your doing is increasing risk and decreasing your reward. Big banks don’t wait on price to rally before buying, they apply a quote that was originated by Warren Buffet “they are greedy when others are fearful”. We built our trading style around the smart money concept combined with Wyckoff theory that allows retail traders to understand what the big banks are doing and when to enter the markets and be able to have minimal drawdowns on your trades while having huge rewards.</p>

              <p class="section-paragraph txt-grey mx-3">On the flip side what we do reaps many rewards which not only benefits us and our clients but the less fortunate as well. This comes in the form of giving back through the Wauchope’s  Charity Programme that collaborates with us at GoldenRules where we use proceeds from our successful venture to donate to the vulnerable in the society. The forgotten ones in plain sight. But we see them and see their needs. We aim to BE the change and touch lives by giving back. Charity begins at home but we extend it to the wider society as an example for others to follow. Our humanitarian efforts are an ongoing project birthed from our trading profits and a genuine love for humanity. The two works in hand resulting in perpetual blessings.</p>
